The first project was developed under the folder "line_follower" and the report/presentation are in the folder "docs" with the prefix "line_follower" as well.
The second project is under the folder "maze_pathfinder" and the report/presentation can be found in the folder "docs" with the prefix "maze_pathfinder".

Let me know if you have any problems running it (dbtds@ua.pt).
